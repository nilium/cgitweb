# Default config
#
# Config values are written K=V. Whitepsace around the equals sign and at EOL is
# preserved. Only K is required. If there is an = but no V, the value is empty.
# If there is no =, the value is TRUE. Multiple K=V values with the same K stack
# and the last value wins.
#
# Boolean values may be TRUE, FALSE, T, F, 0, 1, YES, NO, ON, or OFF.
# All boolean values are case insensitive. Other values are ignored.
#
# Lines beginning in whitespace or a pound (#) are treated as comments. Empty
# lines are ignord.
